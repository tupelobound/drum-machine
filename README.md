freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries project - Build a Drum Machine

This project was completed as part of freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries certificate.

I originally added React to this project using script tags, then rebuilt the project using create-react-app.

Work is needed on this site due to issues with HTML5 audio elements on Safari desktop and mobile devices. Will revisit at some point to learn more about AudioContext.
